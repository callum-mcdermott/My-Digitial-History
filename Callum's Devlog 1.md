# What I did
* Decided to use my own database that I and others at the Museum of Nature have made over the last 6 years. Everything that we have entered into our internal database management software (Portfolio) is on there. (95k ish entries). I wanted to use this data as it was my own (I account for around 15% of all the data). Was a quick download of the metadata from Portfolio
* Data was very messy and clunky and first and I decided to break it up by authors/catalogers. This gave a better idea who has contributed to Portfolio and how much and helps organize things. A lot of people have very small number of entries so I decided to start with myself and then do the largest ones first and only create nodes for people who at least have 10 entries/tags on Portfolio
* Once the data was sorted had to decide on a medium/how was I going to present this information which I decided on a knowledge graph of the catalogers and who they have catalogued to give a better understanding of who is in our Archives and then colour code it based on what that person specializes in (what field) or something like that. Have not quite figured that part out yet
* Gephi was the software I decided to learn for the Knowledge graph
* Played around making dummy/test models to better understand the software. This went well 
* Created a small network of with myself and my co-worker Christina's data in the graph. Still need to fix the size of the nodes to better represent an individuals contribution to the Archive and change the colour scheme but these will probably be left for later.


# Challenges Faced

* How will I Colour Code this?
* How will I be able to get a good size alocation when some people have thousands of entries and others only have 10s.
* In the Future (I will not be able to do this/I do not have time for this) would be to further expand on this with the type of data/images that are associated with the individual to give a better idea of what we are digitizing and what that tells us about the Museum as a whole. Maybe I will have time for this but right now I just want to set the building blocks for this and get a better understanding how Knowledge Graphs work.
