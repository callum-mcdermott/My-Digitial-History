## What I did

* Continued making nodes and relationships for the graph (up to 900ish now)
* On the letter C for Susan (last person but the largest)
* Had to deal with Dinosaurs for the first time and decided to keep them in their scientific name (Latin) as there are no common names for them and most that are used are the genus of the species and this would cause problems for later.
* I doubt I can get *all* of this done for December but I can get a good chunk done and see where I am at by then. The Museum is quite happy with my work so far and is hoping I can help them with a blog about this and how useful knowledge graphs can be the Museum (and indirectly other museums) in April which by then all 3 should be done and with the taxonomy filled out. I doubt it will take me that long.
* Interesting that the graph seems to be naturally seperating the nodes based on their taxonomy with plants being located in one section, dinosaurs in another, birds in another and sprinkling of mammals all over the place. This should get ordered more as I add the different levels and start grouping nodes and colour coding them based on this. This will help the Museum figure out what they have digitizated and what they are over/under representing in their efforts.

## What still needs doing

* Finish as much of Susan as I can and get the taxonomy done. The taxonomy will be added before December to show how this would look if it was fully completed with some of Susan's people just being hidden if they are not finished by this data and I will complete them after this assignment is due for the Museum.
